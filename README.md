## State

Under active development. 

## Principles

Dash is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Dash network allows for highly resilient Dash infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement Dash apps and services.

## Install

### Node

In order to use this library, you will need to add it to your project as a dependency.

Having [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, just type in your terminal : 

```sh
npm install @dashevo/wallet-lib
```

### CDN Standalone

For browser usage, you can also directly rely on unpkg. Below, we also assume you use localforage as your persistance adapter.

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@dashevo/wallet-lib"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/localforage"></script>
const wallet = new Wallet({adapter: localforage});
```

## Usage

In your file, where you want to execute it :

```
const { Wallet, EVENTS } = require('@dashevo/wallet-lib');

const wallet = new Wallet();
const start = () => {
    const account = wallet.getAccount();
    // Do something with account.
}
account.events.on(EVENTS.READY, start);
```

Wallet will by default connects to DAPI and use either localforage (browser based device) or a InMem adapter.  
Account will by default be on expected BIP44 path (...0/0).

### Transports:

Insight-Client has been removed from MVP and is not working since Wallet-lib v3.0.
